# COVID19-App
An iOS/Anroid app that shows the latest coronavirus statistics around the globe. Data is gathered from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/.

I decided to make this public since Android and Apple are rejecting all coronavirus apps made by individuals.

Note: this app was made in less than 5 days so the code isn't A+ quality. 

## Installation
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Tetracyl/COVID19-App COVID19-App`
- Open the repo with Unity 3D (version 2019.3.7 is preferred)
- Press play

### Building Project
If you want to build your project follow these steps:
- Navigate to File > Build Settings
- Chose your preferred build settings
- Press build
